Introduction
> Project Name: demoSmartphoneAPI
> Purpose: To test the functionality and behavior of the API endpoints related to processors, brands, and smartphones.

Test Objectives
> Verify the correctness and accuracy of the API responses.
> Validate the functionality of all API endpoints.
> Ensure proper error handling and validation of input data.
> Test API performance under different load conditions.
> Validate API security measures (if applicable).

Test Scope
> API Endpoints to be tested:
< /AddProcessors
> /GetAllProcessors
> /GetAllBrands
> /GetAllSmartphones

Test Environment
> Operating System: Mac, Windows, or Linux
> Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
> Framework and Dependencies:
>.NET Core SDK 
> RestSharp library
> NUnit testing framework  
> JSON.NET library

Test Approach and Methodology
> Automated API testing using RestSharp and C#
> Test-driven development (TDD) approach
> Unit tests for individual API methods
> Integration tests for API endpoints

Test Cases
Test Case 1: POST /AddProcessors
> Verify successful creation of a new processor.
> Verify error scenarios, such as invalid request or duplicate entry.

Test Case 2: GET /GetAllProcessors
> Verify retrieving all processors from the API.
> Verify the correctness of the returned data.

Test Case 3: GET /GetAllBrands
> Verify retrieving all brands from the API.
> Verify the correctness of the returned data.

Test Case 4: GET /GetAllSmartphones
> Verify retrieving all smartphones from the API.
> Verify the correctness of the returned data.

Test Data
> Predefined test data for initial testing
> Dynamic test data generation for data-driven testing

Test Execution
> Test Execution Approach: Automated test execution using the NUnit testing framework.
> Test Execution Steps:
> Set up the test environment (e.g., start the API server, Docker containers if applicable).
> Execute the test cases using the NUnit test runner or the dotnet test command.
> Capture and log test results, including any failures or errors.
> Tear down the test environment (e.g., stop the API server, clean up any test data or containers).

Reporting and Defect Management
> Test Result Documentation: Record the test results, including pass/fail status, execution time, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
> Defect Management: Use a defect tracking system (e.g., JIRA, GitHub Issues) to log and track any identified issues or defects.
> Collaboration and Communication: Regularly communicate test progress, results, and issues with the development team.

Test Completion Criteria
> All test cases are executed and reviewed for pass/fail status.
> All critical defects are logged and addressed by the development team.
> Test reports and documentation are completed and reviewed.
